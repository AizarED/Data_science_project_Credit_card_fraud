# Data_science_project_Credit_card_fraud
Second project from AiCore. including EDA, Visualisations, Analysis and ML implementations. 
Working the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud the task is to identify whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not

Tasks: 
1) Identify your research question and perform early exploratory analysis on the data
2) Research dealing with imbalanced data and briefly discuss the difference between undersampling and oversampling (about one paragraph each)
3) When relevant in your pre-processing pipeline, implement a method(s) for dealing with imbalanced data
4) Continue exploring your data and attempt to identify variables which could be influential to your response variable.
5) Remember to clean/process your data! (Missing data, outliers etc)
5) Perform dimensionality reduction to visualise your data
6) Identify and discuss at least 2 evaluation metrics suitable for this task
7) Classify your data. I’m looking for processes similar to what you learned in chapter 1 (Grid search, cross validation, different models etc.)
8) Report scores based on the metrics you’ve identified
9) Using a model based method, identify the top 8 most influential variables in the dataset
